Drum Kit is a simple interactive web application that allows users to play drums by pressing the corresponding keyboard keys that are displayed on screen.
This project demonstrates basic web development techniques such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and audio interaction.

Features:

Interactive drum pads that play unique sounds when key is pressed. Keys are mapped to a key on your keyboard(w,a,s,d,j,k,l).
Drum pads animate when associated key is pressed giving visual feedback.
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Major Functions:

Sound playback: HTML audio is used to playback sounds for each drum pad.
Keyboard Event Listener: JavaScript listens for specific keypress events to trigger corresponding sounds.
CSS Animation: Each drum pad has animations that respond to user interactions.
Event Handling: The app uses event listeners to handle keyboard input.

Dependencies:

Uses native JavaScript for functionality and the WEb Audio API for sound playback.
